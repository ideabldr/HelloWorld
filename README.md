Carl Mozingo here. I'm 66 years old. I began programming, as an embedded programmer 
for StorageTek in Louisville, CO. We were writing code, assembly, for a Z80 processor.
That was the start of programming for me, in 1982. Some changes, many projects.

I am now retired living on the Gulf coast in SE Texas. As a more productive use of my 
free time I have collected a few Arduinos, some components, powersupplies. I need an
oscyliscope, some day.
There are a few ideas I have for automated things around the house and property and some
fun projects I'd like to work on. The first actual project I'll work on is an 8x8x8 RGB led 
cube I intend to make and give to my daughter Emily.
